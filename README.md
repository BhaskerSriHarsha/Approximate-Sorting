# Approximate-Sorting
Performing approximate sorting in C++

Problem:

An araay A of elements is said to be in nearly-sorted order, if for each element x in A, the position of x and the rank of x 
differ by atmost 50. Given an array A consisting of n numbers, which are in nearly-sorted order, write a C++ program to sort the given array A of elements in ascending order in O(n) time.
